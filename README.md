Datakit is a library that assists with data analysis and research. It includes classes for working with tables of data and deriving statistical information, importing those tables from file formats such as CSV, a class wrapper with statistical methods for PHP arrays, as well as memory efficient packed arrays.

It also contains a small set of stand-alone functions and defined constants that import across the global namespace.

You can also combine it with [Visualise](https://github.com/sqonk/phext-visualise) to hook up real-time visual output when working from the command line.
